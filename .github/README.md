# DOXter - TEMPORARILY ABANDONED

DOXter is a WIP cog based python coded program. It will use multiple COGS that are custom coded for DOXter to perform multiple tasks. Current COG worked on right now is the DOXcog. This will be a full blown DOXing cog.

## Why use DOXter
Besides having some of the best cogs and cog handling out there, DOXter is free to use. It provides a large range of possibilities for coders and users to take advantage of. Coders are able to code their own fully fledged cogs, with the ability to make them purchasable or free for users. There is a website being built currently for the library of cogs as well as the purchasability of a cog. With unique cog id's your cog will be set apart from everyone elses. This ensures the maximum amount of security for your cog and purchases of said cog. We have a long way to go before the ability for you to create a purchasable cog, but the website where you'll be able to spread your hard work on is not too far away! Show this Terminal some love and we'll show some back. **Enjoy!**
## Installation
As of now: The only way to download is download it ZIPPED from GitHub. - Linux, GIT, CMD, and others will be out soon.
More information on this soon. This is still a WIP with no working COGS out yet.

## Usage
1. Read over the [TOS](https://github.com/StevenHarvey/DOXter/blob/master/TOS.txt) and change the 'False' to 'True' at the end - Note: Syntax needs to stay the same.

## Disclaimer
This is for learning purposes. I do not control, nor do I take responsibility for what users do with my program. The TOS is there for a reason. Please read over it and agree.

## Common Problems
- **The program crashes after inserting a COG** - Please double check spelling of the COG directory, the program's cog handler is still a WIP(This shouldn't be what caused it. Make sure the cog was created for DOXter)

- **When Launching, The program instantly closes** - This is due to either an anti-virus on your computer or a bug in the coding. Try allowing it through the firewall, and if that doesn't  work wait for the problems to be fixed. This is caused by an error in the auto config updater. This will be top priority so just hang in there.

- **Using the source code, I keep getting "NEW VERSION AVAILABLE!" every time I start the program** - This is due to the code simply being outdated, you not fixing the code version at the top of the code, or the config updater being broken.

-- If you're using the source code, try [downloading](https://github.com/StevenHarvey/DOXter/blob/master/main.py) the latest update. 

> - If you've redownloaded the source code and it's just a version update error follow the steps below

1. [Download](https://github.com/StevenHarvey/DOXter/blob/master/main.py) the latest Update

2. Change the version number in the code to the correct version number: ![Image of Version number](https://i.ibb.co/10fbxqg/Capture.png) 

**IF YOU DONT KNOW THE CURRENT VERSION RUN** ```python main.py -u ``` **in a _CMD Terminal_ in the file directory**
